    <p>
        The experiment you are going to participate aims at studying the
        decision process. We ask you to read the full instructions.
        These instructions should let you understand the experiment. <br>
        The experiment is composed of two parts. The instructions below are
        those of part 1. The screen will display the instructions for part 2
        when the first part will be over.<br>
        During the experiment the payoff are in ecus. The conversion rate
        of ecus in euros is given in instructions of each part.

    <h3>
        Part 1
    </h3>
    <p>
        At the beginning of the experiment the server will form random
        groups of two participants. You are not able to identify the other
        player in your group and he/she is not able to identify yourself. You are
        endowed with 20 tokens. You must decide how you divide these 20 tokens
        between two accounts: your individual account and a collective account
        that is common to the two members of your group (you and the other
        member). You concretely have to enter on the screen the number of tokens
        you put in the collective account. The computer will automatically put
        the rest of the tokens in your individual account. You are free to put
        any tokens you want in the collective account. The only constraint is
        that it has to be an integer comprise between 0 and your endowment,
        that is 0 token, 1 token, ..., 19 tokens, 20 tokens (your full
        endowment).
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>
        The accounts
    </h4>
    <h5>
        Your individual account
    </h5>
    <p>
        Each token placed in your individual account earns you 1 ecu. Your
        individual account only earns ecus for you alone. So, for example, if
        you put 6 tokens on your individual account, this will earn you 6 ecus.
    </p>
    <h5>
        The collective account
    </h5>
    <p>
        The collective account is shared by you and the other member of your
        group. Each token placed in the collective account earns 0.6 ecus to each
        member of the group (you and the other member of the group). Similarly,
        each token placed in the collective account by the other member of your
        group earns you 0.6 ecus. Thus, if for example, you place 6 tokens in the
        collective account, this will earn 3.6 ecus for each member of the group
        (you included).
        <br>
        If for example there are 30 tokens in the collective account, your
        payoff from this account is 30 x 0.6 = 18 ecus. The payoff from this
        account of the other member of your group will also be 18 ecus.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>
        Gain
    </h4>
    <p>
        Your gain is equal to the sum of the gains from your individual account
        and the collective account.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>
        Example
    </h4>
    <p>
        You place 14 tokens in the collective account and thus 6 tokens in your
        individual account. Let us suppose that the other member of your group
        places 12 tokens in the collective account. In total, the collective
        account now comprises 14+12 = 26 tokens. Your gain is then equal toÂ 
        6 ecus (individual account) + 26 x 0.6 (collective account) = 21.6 ecus.

    <h4>
        Final details
    </h4>
    <p>
        You will have only one decision to take. <br>
        You and the other participants to this experiment will make your decision
        independently from each other. After all decisions are made and the
        experiment completed, the computer will randomly create groups of two
        participants, which will allow to compute each one's payoffs according to
        the description above. Within one week after the completion of the experiment,
        you will receive a feedback about your decision and the decision made
        by the other member of your group. <br>
        The conversion rate is 1 ecu = ${{ convertion_rate }}.
