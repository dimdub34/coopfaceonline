    <p>
        The experiment you are going to participate aims at studying the
        decision process. We ask you to read the instructions below.
        These instructions should let you understand the experiment.
        <br>
        The experiment is composed of two parts. The instructions below are
        those of part 1. The screen will display the instructions for part 2
        when the first part will be over.
        <br>
        During the experiment the payoffs are in ecus. The conversion
        rate of ecus in euros is given in instructions of each part.

    <h3>
        Part 1
    </h3>
    <p>
        At the beginning of the experiment the server will randomly form
        groups of size two. You are not able to identify the other
        member of your group and he/she is not able to identify yourself.
        You are endowed with 20 tokens and you must decide how you divide these
        20 tokens between two accounts: your individual account and a
        collective account that is common to the two members of your group
        (you and the other member). You concretely have to enter on the screen
        the number of tokens you place in the collective account. The computer
        will automatically put the rest of the tokens in your individual account.
        You are free to place any tokens you want in the collective account. The
        only constraint is that it has to be an integer comprise between 0 and
        your endowment, that is 0 token, 1 token, ..., 19 tokens, 20 tokens
        (your full endowment).
    </p>
    <h4>
        The accounts
    </h4>
    <h5>
        Your individual account
    </h5>
    <p>
        Each token placed in your individual account earns you 1 ecu. Your
        individual account earns ecus for you alone. So, for example, if
        you put 6 tokens on your individual account, this will earn you 6 ecus.
    </p>
    <h5>
        The collective account
    </h5>
    <p>
        Each token placed in the collective account earns 0.6 ecus to each
        member of the group (you and the other member of the group). Similarly,
        each token placed in the collective account by the other member of your
        group earns you 0.6 ecus. Thus, if for example, you place 6 tokens in the
        collective account, this will earn 3.6 ecus for each member of the group
        (you included). Put another way, the total number of tokens placed in
        the collective account by the two players in the group is multiplied by
        1.2 and then divided in two equal parts.
        <br>
        If for example there are 30 tokens in the collective account, your
        payoff from this account is (30 x 1.2) / 2 = 18 ecus. The payoff from
        this account of the other member of your group will also be 18 ecus.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Gain
    </h4>
    <p>
        Your gain is equal to the sum of the gains from your individual account
        and the collective account.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Example (illustrated by the video below)
    </h5>
    <p>
        You place 14 tokens in the collective account and thus 6 tokens in your
        individual account. Let us suppose that the other member of your group
        places 12 tokens in the collective account. As a result, there are
        14+12 = 26 tokens in the collective account. Your gain is therefore
        equal toÂ 6 ecus (individual account) + 15.6 (collective account
        26 x 1.2) / 2) = 21.6 ecus. The gain of the other member of your group is
        equal to 8 (individual account) + 15.6 (collective account
        (26 x 1.2) / 2) = 23.6 ecus.

    <h4>
        Final details
    </h4>
    <p>
        You will have only one decision to take. <br>
        You and the other participants to this experiment will make your decision
        independently from each other. After all decisions are made and the
        experiment completed, the computer will randomly form groups of two
        participants, which will allow to compute each one's payoffs according to
        the description above.<br>
        The conversion rate is 1 ecu = ${{ convertion_rate }}.
